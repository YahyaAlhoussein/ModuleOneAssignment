# ModuleOneAssignment
Objective 1:
Write a program that takes an array (not an ArrayList) of integers, performs some simple transformations on the array, and outputs the results. This program should not use any of Java's built in methods to simply achieve these tasks!
Requirements:
Input an Array (not an ArrayList!): The program should prompt the user to input 5 integers, store them in an array, and print the array.
Reverse the Array: Reverse the array and print it.
Find the Maximum and Minimum Values: Find the largest and smallest numbers in the array and print them.  You should be running this process manually and not using a built in method to give you the answer.
Sum of the Array: Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array and print the result.
Check for an Even Number: Check if the array contains any even number, and print a message based on the result.
Objective 2:
Write a program that takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of characters in each word while maintaining the original order of words.
Requirements:
Prompt the user to input a sentence (a string with multiple words separated by spaces).
Use a StringBuilder to reverse each word individually.
Print the modified sentence with each wordâ€™s characters reversed, but the word order kept the same.
Example:
Input: "Hello World from Java"
Output: "olleH dlroW morf avaJ"
